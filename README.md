# General comments #
    1. Initially, I have many ideas and designs to accomplish this coding puzzle. Due to timelines, I couldn't achieve the same and I've done in a simple way.
    2. In future enhancements, I will need to fix of TO-DO's mentioned in the code.
    3. In future enhancements, a lot of features can be added and effectively designed.
    4. Test cases were not covered as I was interrupted by my project and personal works.
